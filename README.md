Grid Pathfinding Visualizer — BFS / DFS / A*

A real-time pathfinding visualizer built with Python and Pygame.
It allows you to explore how BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms traverse a grid to find a path from a start to a goal cell.

Features

Interactive grid editor: draw and erase walls with the mouse.

Supports BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms.

Diagonal movement toggle (for A* and DFS/BFS).

Shows open set, closed set, current node, and final path.

Adjustable animation speed.

Optional display of g-scores (cost from start for A*).

Reset and clear options for experimentation.

Visual side panel with controls and legend.
